# Build timetable easily uoft

## How to make it work

Go to timetable, enter in a course code and search for courses. The course code should be exact like MAT137, NOT MAT or MAT137H1-F. Drag the downloaded json file (make sure the name is exactly the course code like "MAT137.json") into the courses folder.  
Running timetable.py will generate all possible timetables based on the courses in the courses folder.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8
